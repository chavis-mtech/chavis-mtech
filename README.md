## About Me

I've been building software for **2+ years**, currently working at **Bookengine.com**. I mostly work on systems that help companies manage their staff and payroll, and restaurant systems that update in real time between waiters and the kitchen.

I like making things that are easy to use, easy to fix, and just work well.
